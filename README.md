## Functionality
The InBank loan application service provides a form for submitting loan applications.
The form consists of two sliders for selecting the loan amount and loan period, and a text field for entering the national ID number.
The application communicates with the backend API to calculate the approved loan amount and loan period, which are displayed to the user.

## Components
The application consists of the following main components:

### Frontend Components
**LoanForm**

The LoanForm component displays the loan application form, including the sliders for selecting the loan amount/period and the text field for entering the national ID number.
It communicates with the backend API to calculate the approved loan amount and loan period based on the form inputs.

**ApiService**

The ApiService component provides methods for making API calls to the backend API.
It sends loan application information to the backend API and receives a response with the approved loan amount and loan period.

### Backend Components
**DecisionEngine**

A service class that provides a method for calculating an approved loan amount and period for a customer.

**DecisionEngineController**

A REST endpoint that handles requests for loan decisions.
